        You can now either create a new household, a group where all of your
        pantry items can be saved and shared with any family members you invite,
        or you can join an existing household if you received an invitation code
        via email.
      </p>
      <p className="">
        Once you have a household, you can now start keeping track of your
        pantry and inviting your family members! To start, navigate to the
        Members section via the bottom panel and click on the Invite Members
        button to send invitations for all the members of your household to
        join. Once they accept the invitation and join by the code that they are
        sent, you can now all see and update what items are saved. Then, create
        at least one storage area. A storage area is anywhere in your house that
        you store food items, such as your refrigerator or your pantry. You can
        create as many of these as you like, and they help you keep track of
        where all of your items are kept at a glance.{" "}
